HLA Antibody Analyzer
=====================

Offline app for importing Single Antigen reactivity panels and performing automatic HLA antibody analysis.

Description
-----------
This is an offline app developed to perform state-of-art in silico antibody analysis of Single Antigen reactivity panels belonging to patients waiting for a solid organ transplant. These panels are obtained by histocompatibility laboratories and their analysis enables immunologists to better choose the most immunologically compatible donor-recipient pairs for transplantation.

TODO
-----

* Create automated tests (in progress).
* Group HLA alleles by locus.
* Group HLA alleles by their 2-digit resolution.
* Create charts to display the panel data.
* Perform cluster analysis on MFI values.
* Display MFI cutoff suggestions based on [this research paper](https://journals.lww.com/transplantjournal/Fulltext/2019/04000/Toward_a_Sensible_Single_antigen_Bead_Cutoff_Based.30.aspx).
* Perform virtual crossmatching based on the donor's HLA typing.
* Add a print option.
